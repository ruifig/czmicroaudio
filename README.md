# czmicroaudio

Realtime audio engine focusing on games for microcontrollers. Plays WAV, MOD, IT.

**NOTE** This is not usable at the moment. I was in the middle of porting one of my old audio libraries (https://www.crazygaze.com/blog/czplayer/).
I've commited whatever work in progress I had, but it's not even building at the moment.
